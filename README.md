# Project Name 
  Pwa-challenge 
  
  


## Description
For this project I had to use the starter code which was a text editor, but I had to make the website a pwa so it could be installed and used offline. I did this by using webpack config and creating a initdb to allow the data to be stored and usable offline. Ive learned a skill that allows me to create any client app able to be downloaded and use on a local machine.
